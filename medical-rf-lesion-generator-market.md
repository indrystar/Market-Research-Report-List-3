<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical RF Lesion Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Radio Frequency (RF)</li><li>Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical RF Lesion Generator Market includes two main types: Conventional Radio Frequency (RF) and Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF). Conventional RF delivers continuous high-frequency electrical current to create lesions in targeted nerves, providing long-lasting pain relief. PRF, on the other hand, delivers intermittent bursts of energy, which is believed to reduce the risk of nerve damage and provide more precise pain relief. Both types of RF generators are widely used in pain management procedures to treat chronic pain conditions.</p></p>
