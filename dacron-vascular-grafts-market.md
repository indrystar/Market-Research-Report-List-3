<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dacron Vascular Grafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Porosity</li><li>High Porosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dacron vascular grafts are divided into two main types based on porosity: low porosity and high porosity. Low porosity grafts have a denser structure, which helps in reducing blood leakage and preventing infection. These grafts are often used in small diameter vessels. On the other hand, high porosity grafts have a more open structure, allowing for better tissue integration and less risk of thrombosis. They are typically used in larger diameter vessels or in patients with a higher risk of infection.</p></p>
