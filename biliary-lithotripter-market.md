<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lithotripter</li><li>Ultrasonic Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biliary lithotripters are medical devices used to break down gallstones in the bile duct. There are two main types of biliary lithotripters: mechanical lithotripters and ultrasonic lithotripters. Mechanical lithotripters use mechanical force to crush gallstones, while ultrasonic lithotripters use high-frequency sound waves to break down the stones. Both types of lithotripters are effective in treating gallstones, with each having its own advantages and limitations. The choice between mechanical and ultrasonic lithotripters depends on various factors such as stone size, location, and patient preference.</p></p>
