<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diabetes Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulin</li><li>DPP-4</li><li>GLP-1</li><li>SGLT-2</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diabetes Drugs Market can be classified into four main types: Insulin, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels, while DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists work to increase insulin production and reduce glucose production. SGLT-2 inhibitors, on the other hand, work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion in urine. These drugs play a crucial role in managing diabetes and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
