<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney Cancer Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angiogenesis Inhibitors</li><li>mTOR Inhibitors</li><li>Monoclonal Antibodies</li><li>Cytokine Immunotherapy (IL-2)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Kidney cancer drugs market includes various types of drugs such as Angiogenesis Inhibitors, mTOR Inhibitors, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Cytokine Immunotherapy (IL-2). Angiogenesis Inhibitors work by blocking the development of new blood vessels that supply nutrients to cancer cells. mTOR Inhibitors target the mTOR protein in cancer cells to slow down their growth. Monoclonal Antibodies bind to specific proteins on cancer cells to help the immune system recognize and destroy them. Cytokine Immunotherapy (IL-2) stimulates the immune system to attack and kill cancer cells.</p></p>
