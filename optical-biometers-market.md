<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometers are medical devices used in ophthalmology to measure the axial length of the eye for procedures like cataract surgery. They come in two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact biometers require physical contact with the eye, while non-contact biometers can measure the eye's dimensions without touching it. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, with contact biometers offering higher accuracy but potentially causing discomfort, and non-contact biometers being more convenient for patients. Both types are essential tools for ensuring precise eye measurements in various eye surgeries.</p></p>
