<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rigid Mechanical Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sleeve</li><li>Flanged</li><li>Clamped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rigid mechanical couplings are used to connect two shafts together in order to transmit torque and motion. There are three main types of rigid mechanical couplings: sleeve couplings, flanged couplings, and clamped couplings. Sleeve couplings are compact and simple, consisting of a solid sleeve that connects the two shafts together. Flanged couplings have flanges at the ends that are bolted together for a secure connection. Clamped couplings use bolts and nuts to tighten around the shafts for a strong and reliable connection. Each type has its own advantages and is suitable for different applications.</p></p>
