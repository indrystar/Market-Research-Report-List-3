<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Bottles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum bottle</li><li>Non-vacuum bottle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steel bottles market can be categorized into two main types: vacuum bottles and non-vacuum bottles. Vacuum bottles are designed with a double-walled construction to create a vacuum layer between the walls, which helps in maintaining the temperature of the liquid inside for a longer period of time. On the other hand, non-vacuum bottles do not have this double-walled construction and therefore may not provide the same level of insulation. Both types of bottles offer different benefits and cater to different consumer preferences in terms of insulation and design.</p></p>
