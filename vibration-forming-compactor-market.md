<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vibration Forming Compactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Round Indenter</li><li>Rectangular Indenter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vibration forming compactors are categorized into two types based on the shape of the indenter used during the compaction process. Round indenter compactors utilize a circular indenter, while rectangular indenter compactors use a square or rectangular-shaped indenter. Both types of compactors work by applying vibrational force to densely pack materials together during the compaction process. The choice between round and rectangular indenters would depend on the specific requirements of the application and the desired outcome of the compaction process.</p></p>
