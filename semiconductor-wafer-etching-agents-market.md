<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Wafer Etching Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Etching Agent</li><li>Dry Etching Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor wafer etching agents are used in the manufacturing process to selectively remove layers from a semiconductor wafer. There are two main types of etching agents: wet etching agents and dry etching agents. Wet etching agents involve immersing the wafer in a liquid solution to dissolve the unwanted material, while dry etching agents use plasma or ions to etch the surface. Both types have their own advantages and are used depending on the specific requirements of the manufacturing process.</p></p>
