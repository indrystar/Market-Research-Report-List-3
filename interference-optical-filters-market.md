<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interference Optical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Pass Type</li><li>Low-Pass Type</li><li>Band-Pass Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interference optical filters are classified into three main types based on their filtering capabilities: High-pass type filters allow high-frequency light to pass through while blocking low-frequency light. Low-pass type filters do the opposite, blocking high-frequency light and allowing low-frequency light to pass. Band-pass type filters only allow light within a specific range of frequencies to pass through, blocking all other frequencies. Each type of filter is designed to suit different applications where specific wavelengths of light need to be filtered out or allowed to pass.</p></p>
