<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MIG Welding Torch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MIG welding torches are available in two main types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled torches use water to cool the torch and prevent overheating during prolonged use, making them ideal for heavy-duty welding applications. Air cooled torches, on the other hand, rely on air flow to cool the torch and are typically more lightweight and portable. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific welding requirements and preferences of the user.</p></p>
