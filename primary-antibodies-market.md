<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Antibodies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyclonal</li><li>Monoclonal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Primary antibodies are vital tools used in research and diagnostics. They can be classified into two main types: polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are derived from multiple B-cell lineages and recognize multiple epitopes on an antigen, offering high sensitivity but lower specificity. Monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are derived from a single B-cell lineage and recognize only one specific epitope on an antigen, offering high specificity but lower sensitivity. These two types cater to different research needs and applications in the primary antibodies market.</p></p>
