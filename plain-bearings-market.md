<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plain Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial (radial) Plain Bearing</li><li>Thrust (axial) Plain Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plain bearings are commonly categorized into two main types: radial (radial) plain bearings and thrust (axial) plain bearings. Radial plain bearings primarily support radial loads, meaning they are designed to handle forces acting perpendicular to the shaft. On the other hand, thrust plain bearings are used for axial loads, which are forces acting parallel to the shaft. Both types of plain bearings are crucial in various industrial applications where smooth and efficient rotational movement is necessary.</p></p>
