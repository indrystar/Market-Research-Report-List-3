<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasound Assisted Liposuction Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal UAL</li><li>External UAL</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Internal Ultrasound Assisted Liposuction (UAL) machines are designed with a probe that is inserted under the skin to deliver ultrasound energy directly to the targeted fat cells, allowing for more precise and efficient fat removal. External UAL machines, on the other hand, utilize a non-invasive approach by applying ultrasound energy to the skin's surface to break down fat cells before they are suctioned out. Both types of machines are used in the cosmetic surgery industry to help patients achieve desired body contours.</p></p>
