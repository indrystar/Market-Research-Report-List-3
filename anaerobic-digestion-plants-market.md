<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaerobic Digestion Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mesophilic Digestion</li><li>Thermophilic Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anaerobic Digestion Plants utilize biological processes to break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Mesophilic Digestion operates at moderate temperatures of around 35-45 degrees Celsius, while Thermophilic Digestion operates at higher temperatures of around 50-60 degrees Celsius. Mesophilic Digestion is slower but more stable, while Thermophilic Digestion is faster and more efficient in breaking down waste. Both types of digestion have their own advantages and are used in different scenarios based on the specific requirements of the plant.</p></p>
