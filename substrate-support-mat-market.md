<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Substrate Support Mat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li><li>Non-Intumescent Substrate Support Mat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Substrate support mats can be categorized into two main types: intumescent and non-intumescent. Intumescent substrate support mats are designed to expand and create a protective barrier in the event of a fire, providing additional fire protection to the substrate. On the other hand, non-intumescent substrate support mats do not expand during a fire but still offer support and protection to the substrate. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing the safety and performance of various applications.</p></p>
