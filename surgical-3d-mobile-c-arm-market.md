<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical 3D Mobile C-Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isocentric C-arms</li><li>Non Isocentric C-arms</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical 3D Mobile C-Arm Market consists of two main types: Isocentric C-arms and Non Isocentric C-arms. Isocentric C-arms have a rotating camera that pivots around a single point, allowing for precise and consistent imaging from different angles. On the other hand, Non Isocentric C-arms have a fixed camera position and require manual adjustment for different angles, making them less efficient for complex procedures. Both types play an important role in providing high-quality imaging during surgical interventions.</p></p>
