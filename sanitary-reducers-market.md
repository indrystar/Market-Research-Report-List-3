<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sanitary Reducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sanitary Eccentric Reducer</li><li>Sanitary Concentric Reducer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sanitary reducers are used in piping systems to connect pipes of different sizes while maintaining the flow of fluids. Sanitary eccentric reducers have one side of the reducer set off-center while the other side remains in line with the original pipe, allowing for a gradual reduction in pipe size. On the other hand, sanitary concentric reducers have both sides of the reducer aligned in the center, resulting in a more abrupt reduction in pipe size. Both types of reducers are essential in maintaining sanitation and efficiency in piping systems.</p></p>
